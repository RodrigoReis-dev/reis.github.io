           <h1><span>What is Emotional Intelligence?</span></h1>
           <h1>Emotional Intelligence (or EI) as the ability to:</h1>

        <div class="ei">
          <ul>
            <li>Recognize, understand and manage our own emotions and;</li>
            <li>Recognize, understand and manage our own emotions and;</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>In practical terms, this means being aware that emotions can drive our behavior and impact people (positively and negatively), and learning how to manage those emotions, both our own and others.</p>

        <p>Managing emotions is especially important in situations when we are under pressure. For example, when we are…</p>
         
        <div class="ei">
          <ul>
            <li>Giving and receiving feedback</li>
            <li>Meeting tight deadlines</li>
            <li>Dealing with challenging relationships</li>
            <li>Not having enough resources</li>
            <li>Navigating change</li>
            <li>Working through setbacks and failure</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h1><span>Why Emotional Intelligence is Important </span></h1> 

        <p>It’s a scientific fact that emotions precede thought. When emotions run high, they change the way our brains function…diminishing our cognitive abilities, decision-making powers, and even interpersonal skills. Understanding and managing our emotions (and the emotions of others) helps us to be more successful in both our personal and professional lives.</p>

        <h1>At a personal level, emotional intelligence helps us:</h1>

        <div class="ei">
          <ul>
            <li>Have uncomfortable conversations without hurting feelings</li>
            <li>Manage our emotions when stressed or feeling overwhelmed</li>
            <li>Improve relationships with the people we care about</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h1>At work, emotional intelligence can help us:</h1>

        <div class="ei">
          <ul>
            <li>Resolve conflicts </li>
            <li>Coach and motivate others</li>
            <li>Create a culture of collaboration</li>
            <li>Build psychological safety within teams</li>
          </ul>
        </div>


        <h1><span>Curiosity </span></h1>
        
        <h1>Where Did the Term Emotional Intelligence Come From?</h1>

        <p><em>The term emotional intelligence was created by two researchers, Peter Salavoy and John Mayer in their article “Emotional Intelligence” in the journal Imagination, Cognition, and Personality in 1990. It was later popularized by Dan Goleman in his 1995 book Emotional Intelligence.</em></p>
