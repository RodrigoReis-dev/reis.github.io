        <h1>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h1>

        <p>
          <strong>Dificulty in ask for help:</strong> 
          <br> This is the big one to me and I really have to work on. <br><br>

          <strong>Planning activities:</strong> 
          <br> Planning better the time of the each tasks, I am spending extra time doing more things than necessary.<br><br>

          <strong>Not compare my learning progress:</strong> 
          <br> Impossible be good and take fast learning in everything, then not compare with others will make me feel more confident and focused, for some reason someone will be better than me in something and it is great for my development, raising the level of my learning.
        </p>


        <h1>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h1>

        <p>
         It help me to become better decision maker and give me more self-confidence and helps to build better relationships.

        </p>


        <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>

        <p>
          Core learning surprise me how I can improve myself deal with problems. In a remote work environment, where people aren’t able to easily “see” what their peers are doing, accountability around core values is especially important. By clearly defining your values and building accountability into them, you can start to build a culture of trust, integrity, and honesty. And this, in turn, will lead to higher results. 
        </p>


        <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>

        <p>
          The most challenging aspects is recognize how importantant and start to implement it. 
        </p>


        <h1>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h1>

        <p>
          The tech employers are looking for great human skills, because training to do the job is relatively easier than teaching how to communicate, how to be cooperative and teamwork.
        </p>


        <h1>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h1>

        <p>
          Core learning practice and reflection it has been useful to find out a balance of Core and Technical skills, balance is the most important to developer a great professional.
