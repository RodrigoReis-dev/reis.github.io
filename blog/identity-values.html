            Core values are personal ethics or ideals that guide you when making decisions, building relationships and solving problems. 
            <br><br> Identifying the values that are meaningful to you can help you develop and achieve personal and professional goals. </p>

          <h1><span>About my values and identify</span></h1>
   
          <p>
            We live in times of an increasing rich-poor gap, short-sighted policymaking, environmental problems and concerns, and reactions of various effectiveness to a global pandemic. Our beliefs about the world and our actual experiences shape our values, which in turn form our identity. What we believe is what we experience, which is why our beliefs and values have a discernible impact on our relationships and our work.
          </p>
         
          <p> * <strong>Honesty:</strong>  Honesty is telling the truth.
            It is admitting mistakes even when you know someone might be angry or disappointed. Being honest means that you don’t pretend to be something you are not.
            With honesty, you can trust things to be as they appear.
             <br><br> * <strong>Integrity:</strong> Integrity is standing up for what you believe is right, living by your highest
             values. No matter where you are, who you are with or what you are doing, you will
             act in a way that you believe to the best way to act. It is being honest and sincere
             with others and yourself. You are a person of integrity when your words and actions
             match. You don’t fool yourself into doing what you know is wrong.
             <br><br> * <strong>Empathy:</strong> Empathy is an understanding of our shared humanity. It’s the ability to see yourself in another person’s shoes.
             <br> <br> * <strong>Kindness:</strong> Showing kindness to others does not have to mean doing something big or life changing. Often it’s the smallest acts of kindness that can have the most impact. A moment of support in a time of need, a quiet word of encouragement, a helping hand to carry a heavy load, or just a smile that says "I see you" can make a world of difference. </p>
             
            
          <p>Knowing who you are makes being confident in your decisions and choices that much easier. It can make the difference between an effortless and an agonising decision.</p>
        
          <p><em>"If you could only sense how important you are to the lives of those you meet; how important you can be to people you may never even dream of. There is something of yourself that you leave at every meeting with another person." 
            <br> 'Fred Rogers (Mr. Rogers)'</em></p>
