              <h1><span>Core Blog</span><br><em>What is the Meaning of <strong>Neuroplasticity</strong>?</em> <br> 
              </h1>

          <p>
            Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to adapt. Or, as Dr. Campbell puts it:
            <br><br> 
            
            <em>
            “It refers to the physiological changes in the brain that happen as the result of our interactions with our environment. From the time the brain begins to develop in utero until the day we die, the connections among the cells in our brains reorganize in response to our changing needs. This dynamic process allows us to learn from and adapt to different experiences” <br>
              Celeste Campbell (n.d.).
            </em>
          <br><br>

            Our brains are truly extraordinary; unlike computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates. Different pathways form and fall dormant, are created and are discarded, according to our experiences.
          <br><br>

          When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurons. We rewire our brains to adapt to new circumstances. This happens on a daily basis, but it’s also something that we can encourage and stimulate.

          <h1><span>Neuroplasticity and Learning</span></h1>
   
          <p>
            The relation between neuroplasticity and learning is an easy one to surmise when we learn, we form new pathways in the brain. Each new lesson has the potential to connect new neurons and change our brain’s default mode of operation.
          </p>
         
          <p> Of course, not all learning is created equal learning new facts does not necessarily take advantage of the amazing neuroplasticity of the brain, but learning a new language or a musical instrument certainly does. It is through this sort of learning that we may be able to figure out how to purposefully rewire the brain.
          <br><br> 
             
             
          The extent to which we apply the brain’s near-magical abilities is also dependent on how invested we are in promoting neuroplasticity and how we approach life in general.
         </p>


        <h1><span>A Growth Mindset and Neuroplasticity</span></h1>
             
            
          <p><em>The concepts mirror each other; a growth mindset is a mindset that one’s innate skills, talents, and abilities can be developed and/or improved with determination, while neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to adapt and develop beyond the usual developmental period of childhood.</em></p>
        
          <p>A person with a growth mindset believes that he or she can get smarter, better, or more skilled at something through sustained effort—which is exactly what neuroplasticity tells us. You might say that a growth mindset is simply accepting the idea of <strong>neuroplasticity</strong> on a broad level!</p>

        <img src="/assets/growth-mindset.png" alt="growth-mindset">

        <h1><span>What is a fixed mindset?</span></h1>

        <p>In a fixed mindset, people believe attributes, such as talent and intelligence, are fixed—that's to say, they believe they’re born with the level of intelligence and natural talents they’ll reach in adulthood. </p>

        <p>A fixed-minded person usually avoids challenges in life, gives up easily, and becomes intimidated or threatened by the success of other people. This is in part because a fixed mindset doesn't see intelligence and talent as something you develop—it's something you "are". </p>

        <p>Fixed mindsets can lead to negative thinking. For instance, a person with a fixed mindset might fail at a task and believe it's because they aren't smart enough to do it. Whereas a growth mindset person might fail at the same task and believe it's because they need to spend more time practicing. </p>

        <h1><span>Does Neuroplasticity Change with Age?</span></h1> 

        <p><strong>Children’s</strong> brains are constantly growing, developing, and changing. Each new experience prompts a change in brain structure, function, or both..</p>

        <p>This ability is not absent in <strong>adults</strong>, but it is generally observed less than in children and at lower strengths; however, the adult brain is still capable of extraordinary change.</p>

        <p>It can restore old, lost connections and functions that have not been used in some time, enhance memory, and even enhance overall cognitive skills.</p>

        <p>The potential is generally not as great in older adults as it is in children and young adults, but with sustained effort and a healthy lifestyle, adults are just as able to promote positive change and growth in their brains as the younger generations.</p>

        <h1><span>Benefits Neuroplasticity Has on the Brain</span></h1>

         <p>Building on the studies we just mentioned, there are tons of ways that neuroplasticity benefits the brain. In addition to the improvements and advantages outlined above, these are some of the other ways your brain benefits from brain adaptation:</p>

         <div class="ei">
          <ul>
            <li>Recovery from brain events like strokes;</li>
            <li>Recovery from traumatic brain injuries;</li>
            <li>Ability to rewire functions in the brain (e.g., if an area that controls one sense is damaged, other areas may be able to pick up the slack);</li>
            <li>Losing function in one area may enhance functions in other areas (e.g., if one sense is lost, the others may become heightened);</li>
            <li>Enhanced memory abilities;</li>
            <li>Wide range of enhanced cognitive abilities;</li>
            <li>More effective learning.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>So, how can we apply neuroplasticity and get these benefits?</p>

        <h1><span>How to Rewire Your Brain with Neuroplasticity</span></h1>

        <p>First, let’s get an idea of some of the ways that neuroplasticity can be applied.</p>

        <p>A few of the methods that have been shown to enhance or boost neuroplasticity include:</p>

        <div class="ei">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Intermittent fasting</strong> (as noted earlier): increases synaptic adaptation, promotes neuron growth, improve overall cognitive function, and decreases the risk of neurodegenerative disease;</li>

            <li><strong>Traveling:</strong> exposes your brain to novel stimuli and new environments, opening up new pathways and activity in the brain;</li>

            <li><strong>Using mnemonic devices:</strong> memory training can enhance connectivity in the prefrontal parietal network and prevent some age-related memory loss;</li>

            <li><strong>Learning a musical instrument:</strong> may increase connectivity between brain regions and help form new neural networks;</li>

            <li><strong>Non-dominant hand exercises:</strong> can form new neural pathways and strengthen the connectivity between neurons;</li>

            <li><strong>Reading fiction:</strong> increases and enhances connectivity in the brain;</li>

            <li><strong>Expanding your vocabulary:</strong> activates the visual and auditory processes as well as memory processing;</li>

            <li><strong>Creating artwork:</strong> enhances the connectivity of the brain at rest (the “default mode network” or DMN), which can boost introspection, memory, empathy, attention, and focus;</li>

            <li><strong>Dancing:</strong> reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s and increases neural connectivity;</li>

            <li><strong>Sleeping:</strong> encourages learning retention through the growth of the dendritic spines that act as connections between neurons and help transfer information across cells (Nguyen, 2016).</li>
          </ul>
    

          <h1><span>Conclusion</span></h1>

          <p><em>Basically, <strong>neuroplasticity</strong> can be applied to help you manage, treat, and perhaps even “cure” anxiety, but it takes some time and effort! These more permanent brain changes can be achieved through adapting and changing thought patterns, through recall and memory patterning, breathing exercises, eye patterning, modifying postural habits, increasing body awareness, and targeting sensory perception.
          <br><br>

          Being brave enough to leave your comfort zone can help foster a <strong>growth mindset</strong>. When faced with a challenge, try to choose the harder option that will allow you to grow.
