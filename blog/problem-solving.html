            <em>Problem solving is the act of defining a problem, determining the cause of the problem, identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solutio, and implementing a solution.</em>

          <br>
          <p>
            There are many ways to practice problem-solving, one of the most popular ways is to solve coding challenges.
          </p>
         
          <p> 
            Solving coding challenges on a daily basis can really strengthen the problem-solving muscle and make you more flexible in a particular programming language.
          <br><br> 
          <p>
            In conclusion Problem-solving, like any other skill, needs time and dedication to be developed.

            Strugling is part of the learning process. Thatâ€™s where the growth is happening, but when we start learning something new many times we will feel like embarassing, when I was doing the kata tests and I put me many times so blocked. Some problem that chalange me : loops, arrays manipulations, etc.   
          </p>

        <h1><span>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</span><br> & how confident I feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h1>

            <strong>Console.logging: (7/10)</strong> has been my salvation, is very strong tool, is my first option every time. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>Googling: (6/10)</strong> is another incredible tool whre we can find massive information about almost everything and obviously, people with the similar problem that you have.
            <br><br> 
            <strong>Pseudocode: (5/10)</strong> help me to think step by step through of my code. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>Reading Error Messages: (6/10)</strong> Strong tool, but I need to improve this skills, understand better the message.
